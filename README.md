# carolyn-tries-clojure

My first clojure attempts

### Prereqs

1. JRE 8 + (actually only tested on 11)
2. Clojure? Not sure if you need this actually or if it might be included with the project somehow ... I used [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/) to install the build tool leiningen, `sdk install leiningen`
